## Useful Tips for Beginners

1. **Tab Completion**: Press Tab to auto-complete file/directory names
2. **Command History**: Use ↑ and ↓ arrow keys to navigate previous commands
3. **Ctrl+C**: Stop a running command
4. **Ctrl+L**: Clear the terminal screen (or type `clear`)
5. **Ctrl+R**: Search command history
6. **&&**: Chain commands (run second only if first succeeds)
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
   ```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Don't use `sudo rm -rf /` (deletes everything!)
2. Always double-check before using `rm -rf`
3. Use `rm -i` for interactive confirmation
4. Be careful with wildcards (`*`) in delete commands
5. Always backup important files before major operations

## Practice Exercises

1. Create a project structure:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p myproject/{src,docs,tests}
   touch myproject/README.md
   ls -R myproject
   ```

2. Create and view a file:
   ```bash
   echo "Hello Ubuntu!" > greeting.txt
   cat greeting.txt
   ```

3. Find disk usage:
   ```bash
   df -h
   du -sh ~/*
   ```
